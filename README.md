# evp-design-ui

**evp-design-ui** is a lightweight and easy-custom UI framework with atomlized attributes for React.js.

- <font color=#1E90FF>easy-custom</font> : it provides many apis out of the box to custom the components directly as the way you like rather than siting the nodes by debugging with dev tools hardly.
- <font color=#1E90FF>atomlized</font> : it provides many components with atomic attributes to make the components more quickly to be build.
